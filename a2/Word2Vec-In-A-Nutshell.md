## Word2Vec
Generally, The key insight behind word2vec is that ‘a word is known by the company it keeps’. [1]
Specificly,it is a method in a softwa- re package (see Python below) implementing two different text processing techniques namely CBOW and Skip-Gram which we already touched up on and two different optimization objec- tives, Negative-Sampling and Hierarchical Softmax.[2]

### CBOW

### Skip-Gram


### Traning resut
iter 40000: 9.812206
sanity check: cost at convergence should be around or below 10
training took 3776 seconds
